# Node.js Express API

This is a comprehensive Node.js Express API designed to create, manage, and retrieve dummy user data. It serves as a solid foundation for building more complex API projects or as a convenient tool for generating test data.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the Node.js Express API on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure that you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager)

### Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the API:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using your preferred Git client or by running this command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arindam-seraphic/dummy_user_data.git

Change to the project directory:
cd your-repo-name


Install the project dependencies:
npm install


Start the server:
npm start


The API server should now be running locally at http://localhost:4000.

Usage
The API provides endpoints to generate and retrieve dummy user data. You can customize and extend its functionality as needed.

API Endpoints
The following endpoints are available:

GET /generate-users/:count - Generates a specified number of dummy user records.

Example:   GET http://localhost:4000/generate-users/5


Customization
You can easily customize and extend this API to suit your specific needs:

Modify the sample interests or add your own interests to the sampleInterests array in the code.
Expand the user data model by adding more fields or properties to the user objects.
Implement additional API endpoints and functionality to create, update, or delete user records.


Deployment
This API can be deployed on various platforms to make it accessible over the internet. Here are a few recommended deployment options:

Render: A platform that simplifies deployment and scaling.
Heroku: A cloud platform for building, deploying, and managing applications.
Follow the deployment platform's documentation and best practices to ensure a smooth deployment process.
